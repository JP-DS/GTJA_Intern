# Quantitative Strategy Notebooks

This repository contains a collection of Jupyter notebooks focused on quantitative investment strategies, including:

- **duration.ipynb** – A bond duration modeling algorithm using regression techniques. It estimates the duration of a bond fund by regressing the fund’s return on the returns of its underlying bonds. This allows back-calculating the portfolio weights, which are then used to compute a weighted average duration—providing valuable insights for risk management and interest rate sensitivity analysis.
- **Monthly Fundamental Factor Optimization** – Applies machine learning models like decision trees, random forests, logistic regression, SVM, and PCA to optimize stock selection based on fundamental indicators. The notebook supports monthly rebalancing through classification modeling and feature preprocessing, aiding systematic portfolio construction.
- **Weekly Strategy Optimization** – Focuses on tuning short-term trading strategies based on bond market activity and ChinaBond valuation data. The notebook aims to enhance performance through regular evaluation and adjustment of factors on a weekly basis.

Each notebook includes cleaned code and detailed analysis steps, combining data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation to support portfolio construction and strategy design.
